## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]


### Prerequisites

Our mission was to code a game in Python. So we chose to make a tic-tac-toe. For this, we coded on the PyCharm software.<br /><br />

Rules : <br />

Two players face each other, each with either a cross or a round their goal and align the counters vertically, 
horizontally or diagonally. The player who succeeds wins the game, otherwise it's a draw!   <br /><br />

Specification : <br />

1) The game of tic-tac-toe, 1 vs 1, one human user against another human user. <br /> 
2) Creation of the grid, 3x3 therefore in total 9 boxes available. <br /> 
3) Define the number of joeurs that can play, at home it will be 2. Then,
determine the turn of each player, it will be in turn. <br /> 
4) To choose its box, the user will have to choose the column number
then the number of the line. Its symbol (either X or O) will be written on this
case. <br /> 
5) By default player 1 will have the X sign and player 2 will have the O sign. <br /> 
6) All possibilities are listed where a user can win, i.e. <br />  <br /> 
8 possibilities:
1) 1 1

2) 2 2

3) 3 3

4) 1
1

5) 2
2

6) 3
3

7) 1

8) 3
3
3
 <br /> 
7) We list the possibilities where the match is null, that is to say when no
user has placed the 8 possibilities.  <br /> 
8) Finally, display the result at the end of the game.  <br />  <br />  <br />
